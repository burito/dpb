dpb

These files have been popping up in most of my projects, so this is the best way I can think of to consolidate them, to help prevent instances of me having differing versions of them across my projects.

The "dpb" are my initials, in the vein of Sean Barrett's "stb" libraries, although I wouldn't claim these are anywhere near as polished as his work. Hopefully having them in one place like this may spur me on to change that.
